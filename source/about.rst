About EF5
---------
EF5 is designed to facilitate creation of ensemble forecasts for flash flood prediction. It incorporates multi-model support while maintaining a single set of input data. Currently, the only supported model is the Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) hydrologic model. Additionally, EF5 is optimized for parallel computing—portions of CREST use OpenMP for multi-core processing.

EF5 is a hydrologic modeling platform,
originally developed with the goal of simulating surface water
flows at continental and global scales for early warning
applications. The main target has been the representation of
physical processes describing rapid hydrologic responses to
rainfall, typical of flash floods. Initial support for the
development of EF5 was provided by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration - NASA - and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - NOAA -
to researchers at The University of Oklahoma and National Severe Storms Laboratory.
EF5 is the core hydrologic modeling framework of the Flooded Locations And 
Simulated Hydrographs - FLASH -, a suite of forecasting tools that are used 
operationally by National Weather Service - NWS – forecasters in the United States 
of America. EF5 has also been used for research and applications across different 
regions of the world.
