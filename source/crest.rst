Hydrologic Water Balance Models

CREST
~~~~~
The Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) distributed hydrological model is a hybrid strategy developed by the University of Oklahoma and the NASA SERVIR Project Team. CREST simulates the spatiotemporal variation of water and energy fluxes and storages on a user-defined grid. Its scalability is achieved through sub-grid scale representation of soil moisture storage (using a variable infiltration curve) and runoff generation (using linear reservoirs). Originally developed for global flood predictions, it is also suitable for basin-scale applications.
