Routing Models
--------------
Linear Reservoir
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adapted from the CREST implementation, the linear reservoir routing model uses two reservoirs—one for overland (surface) runoff and one for subsurface runoff.

Kinematic Wave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kinematic wave routing is a simplified approximation of the Barré de Saint-Venant equations. It assumes that gravitational and friction forces cancel and neglects acceleration terms.
