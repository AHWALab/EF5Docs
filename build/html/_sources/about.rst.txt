About EF5
---------
EF5 is designed to facilitate creation of ensemble forecasts for flash flood prediction. It incorporates multi-model support while maintaining a single set of input data. Currently, the only supported model is the Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) hydrologic model. Additionally, EF5 is optimized for parallel computingâ€”portions of CREST use OpenMP for multi-core processing.
