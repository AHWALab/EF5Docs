Hydrologic Water Balance Models
-------------------------------
CREST
~~~~~
The Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) distributed hydrological model is a hybrid strategy developed by the University of Oklahoma and the NASA SERVIR Project Team. CREST simulates the spatiotemporal variation of water and energy fluxes and storages on a user-defined grid. Its scalability is achieved through sub-grid scale representation of soil moisture storage (using a variable infiltration curve) and runoff generation (using linear reservoirs). Originally developed for global flood predictions, it is also suitable for basin-scale applications.

SAC-SMA
~~~~~~~
The Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) Model was developed by the U.S. National Weather Service. Its purpose is to parameterize soil moisture characteristics so that applied moisture is logically distributed, percolation is realistically simulated, and streamflow is effectively modeled.

HP
~~
The Hydrophobic (HP) water balance model assumes an entirely impervious surface where all rainfall is transformed directly into surface runoff.
